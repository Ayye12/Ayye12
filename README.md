- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is ayoub Boujrad and I currently working as an Integration specialist in Benify where my main focus is to develop and integrate our system/portal
with our international clients.

Languages that I've been working with:
  - C#  --> 1 year at Centiro
  - Java --> around 7 months in current position
  - Javascript --> A lot of troubleshooting/rading code in JS in the current position at Benify since the portal is web-based.
  - SQL --> Both previous and current position
  
 Privat development:
  - Javascript --> (Next.js)
  - Typescripts
  - React Native/JS
  - Node.js
  - Tailwind (css)

Recent launched clients that I worked with:
  - BMW (Germany)
  - Warner Media (UK)
  
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m very curious as a person and love to build different things on my spear time. I've been working with React library a lot the recent months and
     I find it really powerfull and funny to work with.
